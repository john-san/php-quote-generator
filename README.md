## Unit 1 Project: Random Quote Generator

**Summary:** This is a random quote generator that was built with PHP.  Users can either click the 'show another quote' button or wait 20 seconds to view a new random quote. 

This project helped me practice the fundamental PHP syntax and better understand how PHP can be used in conjunction HTML and CSS files.  Furthermore, I learned how to use XAMPP to spin up a local server and serve PHP files.


**How to use:**

1. Download the project files and extract the folder to your computer.
2. Copy folder directory to appropriate directory for MAMP/XAMPP/etc setup.
3. Start up local server.
4. View project in browser at appropriate location depending on your local server & directory setup.


**Extra Credit**

1. Added category tags.
2. Added randomBg color.
3. Added auto-refresh after 20 seconds.
4. Added custom CSS styles (such as: smaller quote font size, slight padding from edges, flexbox column container).
